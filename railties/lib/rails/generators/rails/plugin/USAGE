Description:
    The 'quails plugin new' command creates a skeleton for developing any
    kind of Quails extension with ability to run tests using dummy Quails
    application.

Example:
    quails plugin new ~/Code/Ruby/blog

    This generates a skeletal Quails plugin in ~/Code/Ruby/blog.
    See the README in the newly created plugin to get going.
